This little script was used at my last job to create new empty repos on the shared network drive.  It creates the repo,
and sets remote origin, and optionally clones it to your current working directory for you.

To get started, just change "gitdir" in the script to where you want to put your repos and you are good to go.

Usage: make_repo [options] reponame
Options:
	-b, --bare         Do not create initial commit
	-c, --clone        Clone the repository
	-h, --help         Show this help message
	-v, --version      Get the version of this program
